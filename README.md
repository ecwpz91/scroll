# Scroll

A [scroll][1] is a roll of parchment, papyrus, or paper, which has been drawn or written upon.

Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, or divided up into pages, which are sometimes separate sheets of papyrus or parchment glued together at the edges, or may be marked divisions of a continuous roll of writing material.
