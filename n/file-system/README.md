# Chapter 2: Wrangling the File System

## Watcher.js
- `const` sets up a variable with a constant value.
- `require('fs')` pulls in the file system Node module.
- `fs.watch()` is a file system method that polls the target file for changes and invokes the supplied callback function whenever it does.
- `function()` is an anonymous *callback* function (it doesn't have a name).
