The downside of an unpressed suspender would startle Sinatra if he
wasn't such a stinker.  However, manlier lionesses would revile less
verile tinkers, or tinkers seating the tsarina.  Alas, while Kirsten,
the Croatian starlet, was teasing the earringed railmen, Sinatra was
rereading the peelings. I will resuspend each paternal mineral.
Tsarina Kirsten disowned the striken and eviler prenatal partisans.
But who wouldn't relive noiseless rattles and good eatings?  Sleeping
in a raincoat is uncomfortable, another downside to parental teasing.
The sleepless prelate still doesn't understand what this is all about.
